#+begin_verse
I live in Colombia. Many people think Colombia is always hot, but it’s not like that. I live in the capital, Bogotá. It is located at an average altitude of 2,640 meters above sea level. Because of that, it’s normally very cold here, especially at night. For me, it’s a great city to live in, since I LOVE cold weather. It’s warm sometimes, but usually, it’s cloudy and rainy. There are other cities in Colombia where it’s sunny and hot, like Cartagena. Or warm and windy, like San Andrés. It’s great living here because you can find all kinds of weather.
